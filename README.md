## Setup

1. Clone the project
2. Create a `consts.py` file containing the following variables:
    - `username` (WordPress username)
    - `password` (auto-generated application password)
    - `domain_name` (domain name of your WordPress site, e.g. "myfunsite.com")
3. Run `main.py` and a Tkinter window will appear
